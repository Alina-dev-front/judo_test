ABOUT THIS SITE
This site is a primarily my training project. With each next step I went deeper into front-end development technologies and implemented them in my project. Professionals can take a look at my code and find some not elegant solutions. I deliberately did not fix the old code, because I believe that it shows my evolution as a developer.

WHAT TECHNOLOGIES ARE USED AT EACH STAGE
On the main page I used only HTML and CSS.
On the yellow belt page I began to implement JavaScript, but only to count answers and output the result.
Starting with the orange belt I had already a deeper understanding of JavaScript and its functions. I was able to create a loop that is responsible for displaying the necessary techniques to the user in a different order.
For the green, blue and brown belts I created a common JavaScript file that loads the necessary data from the right array for the appropriate level.
